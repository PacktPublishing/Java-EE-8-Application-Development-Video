## About the Video Course
This course is the perfect guide to create a Java EE 8 application. You'll build a real-world chat application and will learn the best patterns and techniques in Java EE.

You'll build a business model for a chat application with CDI and JSON. First, you'll create the skeleton of the business model. Moving on, you’ll learn to add features to the model such as user, message, and chat. Once you’ve set the model, you'll develop a connection between chat client and server using Websockets. Then, you'll create a REST API for other front-end JSclient applications. Finally, you'll develop a UI for the chat application by using the latest version of Java Server Faces JSF 2.3.

By the end of the course, you'll be able to create a full-fledged web application using the new features of Java EE 8.
